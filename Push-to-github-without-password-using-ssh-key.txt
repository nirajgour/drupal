If it is asking you for a username and password, your origin remote is pointing at the https url rather than the ssh url.

Change it to ssh.

For example, a github project like Git will have https url

https://github.com/<Username>/<Project>.git

and the ssh one:

git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git

You can do:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<Username>/<Project>.git

to change the url.

And cheers
